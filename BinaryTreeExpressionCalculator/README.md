# A Math Expression Calculator Incorporating Binary Tree

> Knowldege about stacks, queues, prefix, infix, binary tree, all combined into one. A final project in **Data Structures and Algorithm** that takes a formula from the user which then is capabale of holding values and computation which is represented in a binary tree.

> This also launches a java swing based window for better user input and displays result in the terminal. Enjoy ^\_^

> Note:_I created **Tools.java** here for presentation/styling purposes_

## Objectives

- Natural formula input (infix)
- Converts into a prefix statement
- Ability to present into a Binary tree
- Variable can take value
- Uses PEMDAS to organize precedence values for correct calculation
- Loops calculation through prefix notation

_The code contains errors and may not be runnable in vs code yet, I'm still trying to find it's cause and a solution for it, for the meantime, please look on the recovered docs(pdf file) to view its output. Thanks..._
